    "# Q1: What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "## MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that uses a flexible and scalable document data model to store and manage data. Unlike traditional SQL databases that use tables and rows to organize data, MongoDB stores data in collections of JSON-like documents, allowing for more dynamic and scalable data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not rely on the traditional relational database model used in SQL databases. Instead, they use a variety of data models to store and manage data, including key-value stores, document-oriented databases, column-family stores, and graph databases. Non-relational databases are often preferred for their ability to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, their flexibility, and their scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is unstructured or semi-structured, and where scalability and performance are critical. Some examples of these scenarios include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Big Data and Real-Time Analytics: MongoDB can handle large volumes of unstructured data, making it a popular choice for big data and real-time analytics applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Agile Development: MongoDB's flexible schema makes it a great choice for agile development teams who need to quickly change their data models as their application evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cloud Computing: MongoDB's ability to easily scale out on distributed systems makes it a popular choice for cloud-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Mobile and Web Applications: MongoDB's flexible schema and scalability make it a good fit for mobile and web applications that need to handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Overall, MongoDB's flexibility, scalability, and performance make it a popular choice for many modern applications, particularly those that need to handle large amounts of unstructured data."

    "# Q2: State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that offers several features that make it a flexible and scalable option for storing and managing data. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-oriented data model: MongoDB uses a flexible document-oriented data model that allows for dynamic and scalable data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability and High Availability: MongoDB can scale horizontally across multiple nodes, making it highly available and fault-tolerant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Indexing: MongoDB supports various types of indexes, including single field, compound, multi-key, geospatial, and text indexes, making it easier to query large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Aggregation Framework: MongoDB has a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex queries and data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Replication: MongoDB can automatically replicate data across multiple nodes to ensure high availability and data redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Sharding: MongoDB's sharding feature allows for horizontal partitioning of data across multiple servers to handle large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ACID Transactions: MongoDB supports ACID transactions for specific operations, allowing for data consistency and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Rich Query Language: MongoDB's query language supports complex queries, regular expressions, geospatial queries, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. GridFS: MongoDB's GridFS feature allows for efficient storage and retrieval of large files, such as images and videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Overall, MongoDB's flexible data model, scalability, indexing, replication, and query capabilities make it a popular choice for many modern applications that require high availability and scalability."
