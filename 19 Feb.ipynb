    "# Q1: What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    " \n",
    "## Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python. It is designed to be simple and flexible, allowing developers to easily create web applications and APIs with minimal boilerplate code. Some of the advantages of using Flask include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lightweight and easy to use: Flask is designed to be simple and easy to use. It has a small footprint and minimal dependencies, making it a good choice for building small to medium-sized web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Flexible: Flask is highly customizable, allowing developers to add their own extensions or choose from a wide range of existing extensions. This makes it easy to add functionality to your application as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Python-based: Flask is written in Python, a popular and widely used programming language. This means that developers can take advantage of the many benefits of Python, such as its readability, ease of use, and extensive standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Built-in development server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, which makes it easy to test and debug your application during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Modular: Flask is designed to be modular, with each component (routing, templating, etc.) as a separate module. This makes it easy to swap out individual components as needed, or to use Flask in conjunction with other frameworks or libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Large community: Flask has a large and active community of developers, which means that there is a wealth of documentation, tutorials, and support available to help you get started and troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Overall, Flask is a great choice for building web applications and APIs that are simple, lightweight, and flexible. Its ease of use, customization options, and Python-based design make it a popular choice for developers looking to build scalable and maintainable applications."

    "\n",
    "### The '@app.route()' decorator is used to define a URL route in Flask. It takes the URL path as an argument and maps it to a Python function that handles the request. For example, the code above in exercise: 2 and below creates a route for the URL path \"/hello\" and maps it to a function called 'hello_world()':"

    "\n",
    "+ We use app routes in Flask to handle different types of requests and to build more complex web applications. For example, we might create a route to handle a form submission, or a route to display a user's profile page. By using app routes, we can easily map URLs to specific views and create a clean and organized application structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ App routing is also important for search engine optimization (SEO). By using descriptive URLs that reflect the content of the page, search engines can better understand what our application is about and index it more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Overall, app routing in Flask is a powerful and flexible way to build web applications that can handle a wide range of requests and user interactions."
