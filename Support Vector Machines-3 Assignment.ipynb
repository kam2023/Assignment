MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values, while RMSE measures the square root of the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ In this case, since both the MSE and RMSE values are very close, either metric can be chosen to evaluate the performance of the model. However, it's important to keep in mind that RMSE is a more interpretable metric than MSE, as it is in the same units as the target variable (in this case, the house price). Therefore, if interpretability is a concern, RMSE may be a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Another factor to consider when choosing between MSE and RMSE is the presence of outliers in the data. Since RMSE penalizes larger errors more heavily than MSE, it can be more sensitive to the presence of outliers. In this case, if the dataset has a significant number of outliers, it may be better to use MSE as it is less sensitive to outliers.\n",

Therefore, it is a good measure of how well the model fits the data and how much of the variation in the target variable is captured by the independent variables. A higher R-squared value indicates that the model explains a greater proportion of the variance in the target variable, and thus is a better fit to the data.\n",

R-squared does not provide information on the accuracy of the model's predictions, and it can be misleading if the model is overfitting or underfitting the data. Therefore, other evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) should also be considered to get a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.\n",
