    "### R-squared is a statistical measure that is used to evaluate the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. It is also known as the coefficient of determination and is represented by the symbol R².\n",
    "\n",
    "+ R-squared is calculated as the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (y) that can be explained by the independent variable (x) in the linear regression model. The formula for R-squared is:\n",
    "\n",
    "R² = 1 - (SSres / SStot)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ where SSres is the sum of squared residuals (the difference between the actual y values and the predicted y values), and SStot is the total sum of squares (the difference between the actual y values and the mean y value).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ R-squared ranges from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates that the independent variable does not explain any of the variation in the dependent variable, whereas a value of 1 indicates that the independent variable perfectly explains all the variation in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ An R-squared value closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model, whereas a value closer to 0 indicates a poor fit. However, it is important to note that a high R-squared value does not necessarily mean that the model is good or accurate, as other factors such as overfitting can also affect the performance of the model."

    "1. Sensitivity to outliers: RMSE and MSE are sensitive to outliers, as the squared differences in these metrics place more emphasis on larger errors. This means that a single large error can have a significant impact on the value of these metrics.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Scaling: RMSE, MSE, and MAE are all affected by the scale of the dependent variable. Therefore, it is difficult to compare the performance of models with different units of measurement.\n",

    "4. Biased toward low predictions: MAE is biased toward models that tend to predict values that are lower than the actual values. This is because the absolute values of errors are used in the calculation of MAE, and positive errors (where the predicted value is lower than the actual value) are treated the same as negative errors (where the predicted value is higher than the actual value).\n",

However, they have some disadvantages, including sensitivity to outliers, lack of robustness, and bias toward low predictions.
