    "# A syntax error occurs when the structure of a program does not conform to the rules of the programming language. Syntax errors are usually detected by the compiler or interpreter when the program is being compiled or executed, and they prevent the program from running.

Exceptions are usually caused by runtime errors, such as dividing by zero, trying to access an element in an array with an out-of-bounds index, or trying to access a file that does not exist. Exceptions are not syntax errors, but they can still prevent the program from running if they are not handled properly.\n",

When an exception is thrown, the program will try to execute the code in the catch block, which can handle the exception and allow the program to continue running.
