    "# Q6. What do you understand about the windows function in pandas and list the types of windows functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "## In Pandas, a window function is a way of performing a rolling or expanding calculation over a dataset. It is applied on a defined window size to compute a summary statistic or transformation of the data. The window can be based on a time period, such as days or hours, or it can be based on a fixed-size window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas provides several types of window functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rolling Window Functions: These functions apply a rolling window to a time-series or DataFrame. The window is defined by a size and is moved along the index of the data. Examples include mean(), sum(), min(), max(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Expanding Window Functions: These functions apply a cumulative calculation to the data up to each point in time. The window starts with the first observation and expands to include each subsequent observation. Examples include cumsum(), cumprod(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA): These functions calculate a weighted moving average of a time-series, where more recent values are given greater weight. The weights are typically specified by an exponential decay factor. Examples include ewm(), ewma(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Rolling Apply: These functions allow the user to apply a custom function to a rolling window of data. The function can operate on a single window or on overlapping windows. Examples include rolling_apply(), rolling_agg(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. GroupBy with Rolling: These functions allow the user to apply a rolling window function to groups within a DataFrame. Examples include groupby().rolling(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Overall, window functions are useful for analyzing time-series data and for computing summary statistics over sliding windows of data. They are a powerful tool in the data analyst's toolkit."
