    "# The 'threading' module in Python is used to create, manage, and synchronize threads. It provides a simple and efficient way to implement multithreading in Python programs. The 'threading' module is commonly used in programs that need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as web servers, network applications, and multimedia applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here are some of the most commonly used functions in the 'threading' module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 'Thread': This function is used to create a new thread. It takes a target function as an argument and creates a new thread to execute the target function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 'start': This method is used to start a thread. Once a thread is created, you need to call the 'start' method to start executing the target function in the new thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 'join': This method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution. When a thread is started, the main thread continues to execute, and the new thread runs concurrently. The 'join' method can be used to wait for the new thread to finish before continuing the execution of the main thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 'Lock': This class is used to create a lock object that can be used to synchronize access to shared resources between multiple threads. A lock object can be acquired by one thread at a time, and all other threads that try to acquire the lock are blocked until the lock is released.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. 'Semaphore': This class is used to create a semaphore object that can be used to limit the number of threads that can access a shared resource simultaneously. A semaphore maintains a count of the number of threads that can acquire the semaphore, and when the count reaches zero, all other threads are blocked until a thread releases the semaphore.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. 'Timer': This class is used to create a thread that runs a target function after a specified amount of time. The 'Timer' class is useful for implementing time-based operations, such as periodic tasks and timeouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Overall, the 'threading' module is an essential tool for implementing concurrent programming in Python and can greatly improve the performance and scalability of your applications.\n"

    "# Q5: State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "# Multithreading is a programming technique that allows multiple threads of execution to run concurrently within a single process. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of an application by allowing multiple threads to execute concurrently, thereby taking advantage of the available resources of a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Resource sharing: Multithreading allows threads to share resources such as memory and CPU time, reducing the overhead associated with creating and managing multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Responsiveness: Multithreading can improve the responsiveness of an application by allowing it to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, a user interface can remain responsive while a background task is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simplified coding: Multithreading can simplify coding by allowing different tasks to be implemented as separate threads within a single program. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scalability: Multithreading can improve the scalability of an application by allowing it to take advantage of additional processing power as it becomes available. This can make it easier to support larger numbers of users or higher volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity: Multithreading can increase the complexity of an application by introducing issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and thread safety. These issues can be difficult to debug and resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Overhead: Multithreading can introduce overhead associated with context switching and synchronization between threads. This can reduce the overall performance of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Increased memory usage: Multithreading can increase the memory usage of an application by requiring additional resources to manage and synchronize threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Debugging difficulty: Debugging multithreaded applications can be difficult, as thread interactions can be hard to reproduce and diagnose.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Portability: Multithreading can introduce portability issues, as different operating systems and hardware platforms may have different thread scheduling policies and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ In summary, multithreading can provide significant advantages in terms of performance, responsiveness, and scalability, but it can also introduce complexity, overhead, and debugging difficulties. The decision to use multithreading should be based on the specific requirements of the application and the trade-offs involved in using this programming technique.\n"

Then the first thread and second thread perform their operations on the value, and they race to see which thread can write the value last to the shared variable. The value of the thread that writes its value last is preserved, because the thread is writing over the value that the previous thread wrote.\n",

As a result, each thread stops executing and waits for the other thread to release the variable. Because each thread is holding the variable that the other thread wants, nothing occurs, and the threads remain deadlocked."
